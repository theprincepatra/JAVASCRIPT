# 🚀 JavaScript Learning & Projects — Prince Patra

Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey! This repository contains all the JS files I’ve worked on — from basic concepts to advanced asynchronous programming and mini projects that bring everything together.

---

## 📚 Overview

I’ve been exploring JavaScript deeply, learning everything from the fundamentals (variables, arrays, loops) to advanced topics like promises, callbacks, and async/await. This repo serves as both my personal learning ground and a portfolio of my practice files.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🧩 Core JavaScript

* `Var&itsRule.js` → Variables & naming rules
* `Datatypes&Objects.js` → Data types and working with objects
* `Expression&Condition.js` → Expressions, operators, and conditional logic
* `backtick.js` → Template literals and string interpolation
* `printMarks.js` → Small printing utility / logic-based example
* `stringmethod.js` → Common string manipulation methods
* `ArrayMethods.js` → Array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`
* `loopsinArray.js` → Iterating arrays efficiently
* `mfr.js` → Custom logic (map-filter-reduce practice)
* `factorial.js` → Factorial using loops & recursion

### ⚙️ Asynchronous JavaScript

* `synchronous.js` → How synchronous execution works
* `callback.js` → Understanding callbacks
* `promise.js` → Basics of Promises
* `promisechain.js` → Promise chaining and `.then()` usage
* `PromiseAPI.js` → Working with multiple promises
* `async&await.js` → Cleaner async syntax (to be added)

## 🧪 Projects (Coming Soon)

I’ll soon add mini JavaScript projects to apply all the learned concepts, like:

1. **Quiz App** → DOM manipulation, array logic
2. **Weather API** → Fetch + Promise API handling
3. **Factorial Visualizer** → Logic + UI rendering
4. **To-Do App** → Local storage + event handling

## 🧰 Tools I Use

* **Editor:** VS Code
* **Browser:** Chrome (for dev tools)
* **Runtime:** Node.js
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
